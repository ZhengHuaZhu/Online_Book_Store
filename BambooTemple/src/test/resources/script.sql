Dwight Garner, The New York Times\n\nAn epic account of traveling \r\nthe length of the Oregon Trail the old-fashioned way?in a covered wagon with a team of mules, an audacious journey that hasn?t been attempted in a century?which also chronicles the rich history of the trail, the people who made the \r\nmigration, and its significance to the country.\n\nSpanning two thousand miles and traversing six states from Missouri to the Pacific coast, the Oregon Trail is the route that made America. In the fifteen years before the Civil War, \r\nwhen 400,000 pioneers used the trail to emigrate West''scholars still regard this as the largest land migration in history?it united the coasts, doubled the size of the country, and laid the groundwork for the railroads. Today, \r\namazingly, the trail is all but forgotten.\n\nRinker Buck is no stranger to grand adventures. His first travel narrative, Flight of Passage, was hailed by The New Yorker as a funny, cocky gem of a book,? and with The Oregon Trail he \r\nbrings the most important route in American history back to glorious and vibrant life.\n\nTraveling from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Baker City, Oregon, over the course of four months, Buck is accompanied by three cantankerous mules, his \r\nboisterous brother, Nick, and an ?incurably filthy? Jack Russell terrier named Olive Oyl. Along the way, they dodge thunderstorms in Nebraska, chase runaway mules across the Wyoming plains, scout more than five hundred miles of nearly \r\nvanished trail on foot, cross the Rockies, and make desperate fifty-mile forced marches for water. The Buck brothers repair so many broken wheels and axels that they nearly reinvent the art of wagon travel itself. They also must reckon \r\nwith the ghost of their father, an eccentric yet loveable dreamer whose memory inspired their journey across the plains and whose premature death, many years earlier, has haunted them both ever since.\n\nBut The Oregon Trail is much \r\nmore than an epic adventure. It is also a lively and essential work of history that shatters the comforting myths about the trail years passed down by generations of Americans. Buck introduces readers to the largely forgotten roles \r\nplayed by trailblazing evangelists, friendly Indian tribes, female pioneers, bumbling U.S. Army cavalrymen, and the scam artists who flocked to the frontier to fleece the overland emigrants. Generous portions of the book are devoted to \r\nthe history of old and appealing things like the mule and the wagon. We also learn how the trail accelerated American economic development. Most arresting, perhaps, are the stories of the pioneers themselves?ordinary families whose \r\nextraordinary courage and sacrifice made this country what it became.\n\nAt once a majestic journey across the West, a significant work of history, and a moving personal saga, The Oregon Trail draws readers into the journey of a \r\nlifetime. It is a wildly ambitious work of nonfiction from a true American original. It is a book with a heart as big as the country it crosses.', '28.00', '0.00', '14.00', '2016-02-05 01:21:48', 0),

In the Civil \r\nWar, the West, and many areas overlooked in previous biographies, Custer helped to create modern America, but he could never adapt to it. He freed countless slaves yet rejected new civil rights laws. He proved his heroism but missed the \r\ndark reality of war for so many others. A talented combat leader, he struggled as a manager in the West.\n\nHe tried to make a fortune on Wall Street yet never connected with the new corporate economy.

Thomas J. Christensen argues against this zero-sum vision. Instead, he describes a new paradigm in which the real challenge lies in dissuading China from regional aggression while encouraging the country to contribute to the \r\nglobal order. Drawing on decades of scholarship and experience as a senior diplomat, Christensen offers a compelling new assessment of U.S.-China relations that is essential reading for anyone interested in the future of the globalized \r\nworld.\n\nThe China Challenge shows why China is nowhere near powerful enough to be considered a global ?peer competitor? of the United States, but it is already strong enough to destabilize East Asia and to influence economic and \r\npolitical affairs worldwide. Despite China''s impressive achievements, the Chinese Communist Party faces enormous challenges. Christensen shows how nationalism and the threat of domestic instability influence the party''s decisions on \r\nissues like maritime sovereignty disputes, global financial management, control of the Internet, climate change, and policies toward Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\nChina benefits enormously from the current global order and has no intention \r\nof overthrowing it; but that is not enough. China''s active cooperation is essential to global governance. Never before has a developing country like China been asked to contribute so much to ensure international stability. If China \r\nobstructs international efforts to confront nuclear proliferation, civil conflicts, financial instability, and climate change, those efforts will falter, but even if China merely declines to support such efforts, the problems will grow \r\nvastly more complicated.\n\nAnalyzing U.S.-China policy since the end of the Cold War, Christensen articulates a balanced strategic approach that explains why we should aim not to block China''s rise but rather to help shape its choices \r\nso as to deter regional aggression and encourage China''s active participation in international initiatives that benefit both nations.', '27.95', '0.00', '13.98', '2016-02-05 01:21:48', 0),

(1,6,5,"This book is pure, unadulterated fun, from first word to final credits. Enough 80's kitch to make any fanboy (or girl) randy. Mr. Cline has you in his sights, from the very first page. He's meticulous and stealthy, every twist delights and every turn elicits an emotion. Part action adventure, part love connection, this is a tale with all of the fixings. A classic among post-apocalyptical classics.",1),
(3,5,4,"Even though there are no burning buildings and nuclear bombs this is an post apocalyptic novel if i have ever read one. This book is dark and disturbing and doesn't let up even at the end. This is now one of my all time favorite books. This is not for the faint of heart. I would suggest this to anyone who likes the following genres zombie, post apocalyptic, science fiction. Even though it is none of those things i think it had a strong basis in there creation.",1),
(5,10,3,"All right, I read the other reviews and I understand that a lot of people think this is a really great book. I don't disagree with them if they enjoyed it, but just for balance I want to say that I didn't love it. I was mostly bored most of the time, and particularly unmoved by long passages in which characters interpret the I Ching. So, you've been warned.",1),
(7,13,2,"When I first picked up this book, I thought, wow, how cool is this? The plot seemed very cool and the characters realistic. Reading it, though, I was very disappointed. The book was definitely a [copy] of Lord of the Rings, including a magical token, a wizard, elves, dwarves, and the small common man that has to do great deeds. Don't forget the shadowy evil figure! Besides the copying of the plot, the characters were not very in-depth. I would like to know more about them, but the author barely scratches the surface. Still, some parts were okay, which kept me reading the book until the end. It took forever, as I was bored by it and easily distracted. Overall, it was ok.",1),
(9,15,1,"After hearing the great word of mouth, this novel has generated, I was really excited about purchasing this book and reading it. Unfortunately my memory was refreshed on why I can't stand comic books anymore. Everyone has to keep redefining old superheroes; sadly sometimes (like this) for the worst.",1);
